JavaScript is **Multi-Paradigm** meaning it is a flexible language that can be used with various programming paradigms, namely:

* Procedural/Imperative
* Object Oriented/Classical

## Activity: History of JavaScript

In teams of 3 go to the whiteboard and create a timeline for the history of JavaScript. Decide on major epochs, conflicts, dead-ends, and changes. List the major changes to the language for each phase of your historical timeline. Also consider why this change was made and what the downstream effects were on the ecosystem as a whole.

What are the newest projects in the JavaScript ecosystem? What are the newest changes to the language? Where could the language be heading?
