## Activity: History of JavaScript

In teams of 3 go to the whiteboard and create a timeline for the history of JavaScript. Decide on major epochs, conflicts, dead-ends, and changes.

What are the newest projects in the JavaScript ecosystem? What are the newest changes to the language? Where could the language be heading?
