# Project Planning

## Objectives

1. Explain and utilize the process of User-Centered Development
1. Conduct solo, pair, and team project planning

## Demo: Rotten Potatoes and Q&A
  - Mongo, Models, and Mongoose

## User-Centered Development

User-Centered Development means breaking down a coding project into **user stories** and then coding each one through as a user would use the software. It has the pattern of predicting the next error, and using these predicted errors to guide the process of development.

## Project Planning

User Stories are captured inside some sort of **Project Planning** software or process. The process you use depends on how large and complex your team and the codebase is.

* 1-2 Developers - Todo.txt
* 3-15 Developers - Kanban Board, Trello, Github Projects
* 15+ Developes - Pivot Table, Jira

## Activity: Generate Backlog of User Stories

Start with a `todo.txt` file. For example:

1. Create a file called `todo.txt`
1. Shout out a Domain and an existing application.
1. Shout out anything this new app can do.
1. Order these user stories
1. Break them into rough versions/sprints

Now break into groups and do this for your own faux apps.
