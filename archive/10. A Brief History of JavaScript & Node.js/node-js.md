## Event Driven

"Defined simply: event-driven programming is application flow control that is determined by events or changes in state." - [Understanding the Node.js Event Loop](https://nodesource.com/blog/understanding-the-nodejs-event-loop/)

## Single Threaded

"A thread in computer science is short for a thread of execution. Threads are a way for a program to divide (termed "split") itself into two or more simultaneously (or pseudo-simultaneously) running tasks. Threads and processes differ from one operating system to another but, in general, a thread is contained inside a process and different threads in the same process share same resources while different processes in the same multitasking operating system do not. Threads are lightweight, in terms of the system resources they consume, as compared with processes." - [Wikipedia - Thread (computer science)](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science))

## Non-Blocking

## I/O Runtime

"In computing, input/output or I/O (or, informally, io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a computer, and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. Inputs are the signals or data received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. The term can also be used as part of an action; to "perform I/O" is to perform an input or output operation." [Wikipedia - Input/output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output)

## Written in C

It is written in C, not in JavaScript :D.

## Invented in 2009 by Ryan Dahl

Ryan Dahl at JSConf 2009 introduced a JavaScript server he had build using the V8 engine he called it "an event-driven, single-threaded, non-blocking I/O Runtime written in C called Node.js".

## What's Next

Now Ryan Dahl is making a competitor to node called Deno written in Typescript.
