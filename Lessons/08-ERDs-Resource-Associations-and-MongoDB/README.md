# MongoDB Associations & Queries

## Objectives

1. Master drawing a simple **Entity Relationship Diagrams** (ERDs) (2-5 resources)
1. Utilize the common verbiage for defining **Resource Associations**

## ERD Bears

Consider three resources: Fishes, Bears, Trees, and Picnics

![erd-bears](assets/erd-bears.jpg)

1. Bears have many trees, trees belong to one bear
2. Bears have one fish, fish belongs to one bear
3. Bears have and belong to many picnics

## Associations (10 min)

There are three sorts of resource associations:

1. **One-to-Many** or *Has Many/Belongs To*
1. **One-to-One** or *Has One/Belongs To*
1. **Many-to-Many** or *Has And Belongs to Many*, or *Has Many Through*

### Examples

* **[Common] Facebook** - One to Many:
    * Users have many Posts
    * Users have many Comments
    * Users have many Likes

* **[Common] Eventbright** - Has and Belongs to Many:
    * Users have many Events as reservations
    * Users belong to many Events as guests

* **[Rare] Eventbright** - Has One/Belongs To
    * User has one Profile
    * User has one Credit Card

## Entity Relationship Diagramsâ€”ERDs (5 min)

Before you code a project, it is good to spend about an hour completing three deliverables:

1. User Journeys (UX)
2. Wireframes (UI)
3. An Entity Relationship Diagram (Architecture)

These three will give you an baseline idea of the structure of your project before beginning. And they only take a few minutes to complete.

Let's look at how to draw ERDs.

Connect resources in boxes with arrows depending on their relationship:

1. Many-to-One: `=>`
1. Many-to-Many: `<=>`
1. One-to-Many: `-->`

## Activity - Drawing ERDs (15 min)

Draw ERDs for the core features of 3 the following applications. You can pick your own products if you like to draw. When you finish your first, check with a partner. Form into groups of 4 and show your favorites off.

1. Lyft
1. Pinterest
1. Airbnb
1. Facebook
1. Apple App Store

## Modeling Associations Using MongoDB (20 min)

In a document-based database these **Resource Associations** are modeled in a few ways. Here they are ordered by frequency

1. Reference Documents (very common)
2. Value Associations (pretty common)
3. Embedded Documents (very rare)

### Reference Documents (very common)

Very common for one-to-many and many-to-many associations.

*Have Many/Belongs To* - Users have many Posts, Posts belong to Users as "Author"

```js
// USER HAS MANY POSTS
{
  "name": "John Brown",
  "posts": ["a41492308329r900sdf", "9309safd0as0f9f098af"]
}

// POST BELONGS TO USER (AS AUTHOR)
{
  "title": "John Brown",
  "author": "asf675as6f6a4s6f"
}

// TODO: Convert to Python
// GIVE ME A USER AND ALL THEIR POSTS
User.findById(userId).populate('posts').then(...).catch(...);


// TODO: Convert to Python
// GIVE ME ALL POSTS BY ONE USER
Post.find({author: userId}).then(...).catch(...);
```

Implementation:

```js
// TODO: Convert to Python
const UserSchema = new Schema({
    name      : { type: String, required: true },

    posts     : [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Post' }]
});

const PostSchema = new Schema({
    title      : { type: String, required: true },
    body       : { type: String, required: true },

    author     : { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
});

```


*Has and Belongs to Many* - Users Have and Belong to Many Events as "Guests"

```js
// TODO: Convert to Python
const UserSchema = new Schema({
    name      : { type: String, required: true },

    rsvps     : [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Event' }]
});

const EventSchema = new Schema({
    title      : { type: String, required: true },
    desc       : { type: String, required: true },

    guests     : [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }]
});
```

### Value Association (pretty common)

```js
// Post belongs to Subreddit
{
  "title": "",
  "subreddit": "Jugglers Anonymous"
}

// GIVE ME ALL POSTS IN ONE SUBREDDIT
// TODO: Convert to Python
Post.find({subreddit: "Jugglers Anonymous"}).then(...).catch(...);

// User belongs to City
{
  "name": "John Brown",
  "city": "San Francisco"
}

// GIVE ME ALL USERS IN ONE CITY
// TODO: Convert to Python
User.find({city: "San Francisco"}).then(...).catch(...);
```

Implementation:

```js

// TODO: Convert to Python
const mongoose = require('mongoose'),
      Schema = mongoose.Schema;

const RestaurantSchema = new Schema({
    , name       : { type: String, required: true }
    , category   : String
    , tags       : [String]

    , owner      : { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }
},{
    timestamps: true
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('Review', ReviewSchema);
```

### Embedded Documents (very rare)

Rare for one-to-many associations. Only use when you always want all children to appear with the parent. Also if you don't want to edit the children very much or at all.

```js
// Comments belong to Post
{
  "title": "Awesome Article",
  "comments": [
    { "content": "What a great article" },
    { "content": "Agreed!" }
  ]
}

```

Implementation:

```js
// TODO: Convert to Python
const CommentSchema = new Schema({ title: String, content: String });

const ArticleSchema = new Schema({
    , title      : { type: String, required: true }
    , content    : { type: String, required: true }

    , author     : { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true }
    , comments   : [CommentSchema]
},{
    timestamps: true
});
```

## Activity: Code Review (15 min)

Pair up and review one another's implementation of Playlistr.

Review code for:

1. Completeness
2. Variable naming
3. Spacing and Indentation
4. Modularity and file structure
5. Usability and style
