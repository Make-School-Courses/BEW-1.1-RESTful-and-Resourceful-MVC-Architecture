## Objectives

1. Master drawing a simple **Entity Relationship Diagrams** (ERDs) (2-5 resources)
1. Utilize the common verbiage for defining **Resource Associations**

<!-- > -->

# Resource Associations

<!-- v -->

## Types of Associations

There are three sorts of resource associations:

1. **One-to-Many** or *Has Many/Belongs To*
1. **One-to-One** or *Has One/Belongs To*
1. **Many-to-Many** or *Has And Belongs to Many*, or *Has Many Through*

<!-- v -->

## One-to-One

A **person** has _exactly_ one **passport**. (A passport belongs to one person.)

![one-to-one](assets/one-to-one.png)

<!-- v -->

## One-to-Many

A **person** _has many_ **pets**. (A pet belongs to exactly one person.)

![one-to-many](assets/one-to-many.png)

<!-- v -->

## Many-to-Many

A **person** _can attend many_ **picnics**, and many people can attend one picnic.

<!-- v -->

## Examples

<div class="compact">

* **[Common] Facebook** - One to Many:
    * Users have many Posts
    * Users have many Comments
    * Users have many Likes

* **[Common] Eventbright** - Has and Belongs to Many:
    * Users have many Events as reservations
    * Users belong to many Events as guests

* **[Rare] Eventbright** - Has One/Belongs To
    * User has one Profile
    * User has one Credit Card
</div>

## Entity Relationship Diagrams — ERDs

Before you code a project, it's a good idea to spend some time thinking about the relationships between objects.

Connect resources in boxes with arrows depending on their relationship:

1. Many-to-One: `=>`
1. Many-to-Many: `<=>`
1. One-to-Many: `-->`

## Activity - Drawing ERDs [15 min]

Draw ERDs for the core features of 3 the following applications. When you finish each one, check with a partner. Form into groups of 4 and show your favorites off.

1. Lyft
1. Pinterest
1. Airbnb
1. Facebook
1. Apple App Store

# Modeling Associations

<!-- v -->

## Modeling Associations Using MongoDB

In a document-based database these **Resource Associations** are modeled in a few ways. Here they are ordered by frequency

1. Reference Documents (very common)
2. Value Associations (pretty common)
3. Embedded Documents (very rare)

<!-- v -->

## Reference Documents

In this case, each **document** (e.g. user or post) contains a reference to the **_id** field of the documents it's related to.

```py
# User has many posts
{
  "name": "Jamar Brown",
  "posts": ["a41492308329r900sdf", "9309safd0as0f9f098af"]
}

# Post belongs to user (as author)
{
  "title": "Understanding Model View Controller",
  "author": "asf675as6f6a4s6f"
}
```

<!-- v -->

## Value Association

In this case, a document contains a reference to the **value** (usually a name or ID code) of its related documents. The document for a Reddit post might look like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Mastering the Three Ball Cascade",
  "subreddit": "Jugglers Anonymous"
}
```

And we can find all posts in a subreddit like this:

```py
# Return all Posts in a specific subreddit:
juggling_posts = db.Posts.find({subreddit: "Jugglers Anonymous"})
for post in juggling_posts:
    print(post.title)
```

<!-- v -->

## Embedded Documents

Rare for one-to-many associations.

Only use when you always want all children to appear with the parent, or if you don't want to edit the children very much or at all.

```py
embedded_post = {
  "title": "Awesome Article",
  "comments": [
    { "content": "What a great article" },
    { "content": "Agreed!" }
  ]
}

db.Posts.insert_one(embedded_post)
```

<!-- v -->

## Activity

Choose one of your resource diagrams and decide whether to model the associations as a **Reference to Document**, **Value Association**, or **Embedded Document**. What are the pros and cons of each?
