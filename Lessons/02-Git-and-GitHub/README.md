## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand how to take a real project and integrate it with Git/GitHub.
1. Create well-crafted commit messages.
1. Practice basic pull requests and resolve basic merge conflicts.

<!-- > -->

## Initial Exercise

Think of 3 challenges you have faced when using Git or GitHub. 

Then, share with a partner and compare/contrast your experiences.

# Version Control

<!-- v -->

## What is Version Control?

Version control is software that helps a software team manage changes to source code over time. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Source: [Atlassian Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

<!-- v -->

## Benefits of Version Control

Version control allows you to:

- Review previous versions of your code<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Revert to a previous version in case of errors<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Experiment with new features without fear of breaking your code<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Collaborate effectively & split up work without blocking each other's changes<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- v -->

## Git is Decentralized

A centralized file system is like a bank: There is one central "source of truth" with a ledger of all changes made. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

GitHub is more like Bitcoin: Every person can have their own version of a repository that is equally valid! <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Unlike Bitcoin, we can also rewrite history! (This isn't recommended if others have already pulled your changes.)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<!-- > -->

# Review: Bash Commands

<!-- v -->

## Bash Commands

How do we do the following in Bash?

- View the current file path? `pwd`<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Make a new directory? `mkdir name_of_directory`<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Navigate into (or out of) a directory? <span> `cd name_of_directory` or `cd ..`</span><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- See all files in the current directory? `ls`<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Create a new file? `touch file_name`<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Git Workflow

<!-- v -->

## Basic Git Workflow

Here is an example of how to initialize a Git repository:

```bash
$ git init
$ git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>
```

And how to make changes and push them to GitHub:

```bash
$ git add <your_file_name>
$ git commit -m "Update server code and add 2 routes"
$ git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

<aside class="notes">
Usually, the remote name is called "origin" and the branch name is called "master". It's good to follow this convention unless you have multiple remotes or branches.
</aside>

You can pull in changes someone else has made with:

```bash
$ git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>
```

<aside class="notes">
- `git init` will initialize a Git repository inside of the current directory. We can prove it was initialized by using `ls -a` to see hidden files.
- `git remote add origin` adds a _remote_ (short for "remote repository") named _origin_.
- `git add` is like adding our files to a shopping cart. We may not want to check out just yet - this allows us to still make some changes before pushing.
- `git commit` makes a _commit_ to our local repository containing our changes. It still won't be reflected in GitHub!
- `git push` sends all of the commits we've made to the remote we added. The remote name by default is "origin", and the branch name by default is "master".
</aside>

<!-- v -->

## Git Clone

Another way to initialize a repository is to _clone_ an existing one.

```bash
$ git clone <remote_url>
```

Note that if you are not the repository's owner (or a collaborator), you will not be able to push your changes! Instead, create a new, empty GitHub repository and add it as a remote with `git remote add` as shown above.

<!-- v -->

## Git Debugging

There are a few useful commands to get the "lay of the land" and aid in debugging:

- `git status` - Run before and/or after adding files
- `git log` - shows previous commits
- `git diff` - shows diffs in untracked files

<!-- v -->

## gitignore

Add a file called `.gitignore` to specify any files that you don't want to be tracked. For example, my `.gitignore` file might include the following contents:

```
env/
__pycache__
.DS_STORE
```

Check out [gitignore.io](http://gitignore.io/) to automatically generate a .gitignore file!

## Activity: Set up your Homework Repository [5 min]

If you haven't yet, initialize a repository in your BEW1.1 Homework folder, and follow the steps to push your changes to GitHub.

<!-- > -->

# Activity: Create a Merge Conflict

<!-- v -->

## What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflicts occur when you attempt to pull in changes that _conflict with_ (i.e. change the same lines as) your changes.

They are a normal part of working with Git and it's good to practice them!

<!-- v -->

## Let's Create a Merge Conflict! [10 mins]

In your homework directory, change a few lines of code, add, and commit (but don't push).

Then, go to the corresponding GitHub repository and change those _same_ lines of code in a _different_ way.

Try `git pull origin master`. You should get a merge conflict! See if you can resolve it.

<!-- v -->

## Merge Conflicts with a Partner [15 mins]

Pair up with someone you haven't worked with yet.

Clone your partner's repository. Then, both make changes to the _same lines of code_ and try to push your changes.

# GitHub Desktop

<!-- v -->

## What is GitHub Desktop?

<aside class="notes">
GitHub Desktop is a desktop client that takes a lot of the pain out of using command-line Git. It will help you do all of the basic commands - add, commit, and push - and will give you visual reminders of what changes you have made.
</aside>

<!-- v -->

## Why GitHub Desktop?

It is...

- Easy and straightforward to use
- More visual
- Shows side-by-side file diffs

<!-- v -->

## How do I install it?

[Download for MacOS!](https://desktop.github.com/)
