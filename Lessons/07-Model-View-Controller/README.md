## Essential Question

How do pages on the Web communicate with each other?

## Think, Pair, Share [15 mins]

Let's say I go to Amazon.com, search for an item, and put it into my shopping cart.

*How* does this happen? If Amazon were an app written in Flask, what would it look like? Write down *everything* you know.

# Model, View, Controller

<!-- v -->

## Overview

When we write code for a web server, we typically use a convention known as **Model, View, Controller**.

## Controller

The **controller** is like the waiter.

In our Flask application, the **controller** is the routes contained in `app.py`.

## View

The **view** is like the menu.

In our Flask application, our **views** are the HTML pages.

## Model

The **model** is like the food!

In our Flask application, the **model** is the data being passed back and forth between the client and server.

## Activity

1. What are the Model, View, and Controller, and what do they represent in our Flask app? Make sure each person understands before moving on.
1. Choose a website that you use frequently and at least one way you interact with that website. Ex: Searching for cat videos on YouTube.
1. Decide who will be the Model, View, Controller, and User. Write a short skit and have each person act out their role.
1. Practice your skit!
