## Jigsaw Activity [30 min]

Get into groups of 4 or 5 and research a *specific* form element. Within your group, do the following:

- Test out the form element in your browser. How does it work?
- What *attributes* (such as `name`, `value`, etc) are required to use this form element? What do they do?
- What *query string* results when you submit the form?

*Every* person in the group *must* be able to present the findings!
