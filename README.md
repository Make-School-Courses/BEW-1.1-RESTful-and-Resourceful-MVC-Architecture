## Course Description

This course covers the three major patterns or architectures that make the web work; REST, Resources, and MVC. Students will use JavaScript, ExpressJS and NodeJS to illustrate these patterns, but the patterns themselves are language independent and are repeated across many common servers. Other key concepts covered include server-side templating, controller testing, associating and nesting resources, state, convention over configuration, and the request-response cycle.

## Prerequisites

1. Make School Prework / RAMP

## Learning Objectives

1. Explain the MVC architecture for web server development.
2. Use Resourceful Routes and explain the importance of Resourceful web architecture.
3. Read and write to a Document-Based (NoSQL) database using a Object Document Mapper (ODM)
4. Use Web application frameworks, middleware packages, and server-side templating.
5. Implement controller testing patterns.
