## Course Description

This course covers the three major patterns or architectures that make the web work; REST, Resources, and MVC. Students will use JavaScript, ExpressJS and NodeJS to illustrate these patterns, but the patterns themselves are language independent and are repeated across many common servers. Other key concepts covered include server-side templating, controller testing, associating and nesting resources, state, convention over configuration, and the request-response cycle.

## Prerequisites

1. Make School Prework

## Learning Objectives or Competencies (5-8)

1. Master the MVC architecture for web server development.
1. Master and memorize Resourceful Routes and in general describe the importance of Resourceful web architecture.
1. Read and write to a Document-Based (NoSQL) database (in this case MongoDB) using a Object Document Mapper (ODM)
1. Master ExpressJS and extend it by installing, initializing, and using its various middleware packages including server-side templating using HandlebarsJS.
1. Master initial controller testing patterns with Mocha.js and Chai.js
