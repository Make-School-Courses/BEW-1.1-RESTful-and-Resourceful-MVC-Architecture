## Course Description

This course covers the three major patterns or architectures that make the web work; REST, Resources, and MVC. Students will use JavaScript, ExpressJS and NodeJS to illustrate these patterns, but the patterns themselves are language independent and are repeated across many common servers. Other key concepts covered include server-side templating, controller testing, associating and nesting resources, state, convention over configuration, and the request-response cycle.

## Prerequisites

1. Make School Prework

## Learning Objectives

1. Master the MVC architecture for web server development.
2. Master and memorize Resourceful Routes and in general describe the importance of Resourceful web architecture.
3. Read and write to a Document-Based (NoSQL) database (in this case MongoDB) using a Object Document Mapper (ODM)
4. Master ExpressJS and extend it by installing, initializing, and using its various middleware packages including server-side templating using HandlebarsJS.
5. Master initial controller testing patterns with Mocha.js and Chai.js

## Class Assignments

### Tutorials

Tutorials are to help you get started in a topic.  They are graded on completion only.

1. [**REQUIRED**] [**Giphy Search App**](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/giphy-search-app-with-node-js): Complete by Friday, Week 1 _(must have at least 4 agile commits)_
2. [**REQUIRED**] [**Rotten Potatoes**](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/rotten-potatoes---movie-reviews-with-express-js): Complete by Friday, Week 2 _(must have at least 10 agile commits)_
3. [**OPTIONAL**] [**Rotten Potatoes: Part Deux**](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/rotten-potatoes---movie-reviews-with-express-js-rge): Complete by Friday, Week 4


### Projects
**All projects will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

Projects are a chance for you to build and ship code that is based on class concepts.  Many are open ended allowing you to be creative and to have individual work for your portfolio.

#### **Contractor Project**

##### Phases

- V1 - Beginning of Week 5
- V2 - Beginning of Week 6
- V3 - Middle of Week 7 (Presentations)

##### Requirements

_**You must meet ALL requirements to pass the Contractor Project.**_ Stretch challenges are optional, and are opportunities to dive deeper upon early project completion.

- Written in JavaScript using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB
- Written in MVC with separate files for each concern
- CRUD >=2 Resources and associate them
- 100% test coverage of all routes
- A conventional UI using Bootstrap 4
- Pushed live to Heroku
- Must have at least 10 agile commits
- Presentation => Present the feature (and its code) that you are most proud of

###### Stretch Challenges

- AJAX requests for POST/PUT/DELETE requests - Server-side rendering for GET requests (optional)
- Use an external API (optional)

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials
- Pass all projects according to the requirements
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance

Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
