## Course Description

This course covers the three major patterns or architectures that make the web work; REST, Resources, and MVC. Students will learn language independent patterns that are repeated across many common servers. Other key concepts covered include server-side templating, controller testing, associating and nesting resources, state, convention over configuration, and the request-response cycle.

## Prerequisites

1. Make School Prework / RAMP

## Learning Objectives

1. Explain the MVC architecture for web server development.
2. Use Resourceful Routes and explain the importance of Resourceful web architecture.
3. Read and write to a Document-Based (NoSQL) database using a Object Document Mapper (ODM)
4. Use Web application frameworks, middleware packages, and server-side templating.
5. Implement controller testing patterns.
